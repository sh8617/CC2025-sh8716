# Week 1 Reading Notes

## Quote 1
> "The digital age challenges us to rethink the limits of the human mind: What are the boundaries of my cognition?"  
> Douglas Rushkoff, *Program or Be Programmed*, p.16  

This made me think about how technology works as an extension of our brains. In real life, smartphones and AI tools don’t just change how I think — they even redefine what “myself” means. In this class, learning to code will also expand those boundaries, because it lets us extend our thinking into machines and shape how they actually work.

## Quote 2
> "With computers and networks, unlike our calculators, we don’t even know what we are asking our machines to do, much less how they are going to go about doing it."  
> Douglas Rushkoff, *Program or Be Programmed*, p.17  

I think this quote is really down to earth. We rely on search engines every single day, but we rarely — if ever — question how the results are ranked or filtered. Learning programming can help us understand and challenge these systems. By seeing how code works, instead of blindly trusting a “black box,” we can build stronger independent and critical thinking skills.

## Quote 3
> "Contemplation itself is devalued."  
> Douglas Rushkoff, *Program or Be Programmed*, p.18  

This quote really shows how hard it is to stay focused in the digital age. Personally, I get distracted all the time by nonstop notifications, which leaves me almost no space for deep thinking. But coding actually forces me to slow down — it takes patience and focus. Without deep thinking, it’s almost impossible to debug or design logical solutions. Learning programming is like training myself to get that focus back.
